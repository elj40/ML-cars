# AI-cars-1
My own implementation of how AI cars would work

Uses a waypoint system but cars still need to find optimum path between waypoints

## Current AI's
FirstUseful: First AI capable of finishing a lap (I think)
CarAgent: Decent agent that trained on low grip
CarAgent1: CarAgent after some more training
AdjustedCar1: Good agent trained off original input (didn't have distance to next next waypoint)

## To do
Add and test the following inputs:
	-Another waypoint depth(see farther into the future)
	-Is drifting?

Add a good looking track
