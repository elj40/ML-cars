# AI-cars-1
My own implementation of how AI cars would work

Uses a waypoint system but cars still need to find optimum path between waypoints

## Current AI's


## To do

1. Rebuild car to basic function with ML Agents
	- ~~Use raycasting method as inputs for the car~~
		- ~~Redirect control from inputs through heuristics~~
		- ~~Setup inputs (raycast distance * [5,6,7], speed, isDrifting)~~
		- ~~Setup outputs: discrete (acc,brake,hbrake,left,right)~~
	- Train a model using only raycast and simple inputs (benchmark model)
		- ~~Setup Rewards
		- ~~Should be minimise lap time

2. Design more tracks to practice different techniques
	- Shallow turns
	- Long straights into different turns
3. See if a combination of waypoints and perecptrons can work
4. Design a UI system to easily debug
